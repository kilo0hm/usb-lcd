Connect a HD44780 LCD to USB, via the CH341A IC. This adapter can interface with LCD Smartie, LCDHype, and AIDA64 on Windows. Linux support should be possible too.

See my prototype version working [here](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/TWgQVQCoLs0), and the Rev.A pcb [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QafS92o0JMY).

The PCB layout is inspired by the I2C adapter boards commonly found online. It should fit on the back any 16 pin LCD module with a HD44780 (or compatible) driver.

This project was made using the documentation and plugins from ABACOM. You can buy their USB LCD, as well as see all the documentation [here](https://www.electronic-software-shop.com/hardware/usb-lcd-display-4x20-zeichen-gruen.html).
