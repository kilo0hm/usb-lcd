Connect a HD44780 LCD to USB, via the CH341A IC. This LCD can interface with LCD Smartie, LCDHype, and AIDA64 on Windows. Linux support should be possible too.

See my prototype version working [here](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/TWgQVQCoLs0).

This project was made using the documentation and plugins from ABACOM. You can buy their USB LCD, as well as see all the documentation [here](https://www.electronic-software-shop.com/hardware/usb-lcd-display-4x20-zeichen-gruen.html).
